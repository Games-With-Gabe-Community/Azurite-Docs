				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>The Renderer Framework for Azurite is very flexible. You don't need to know how to use the Framework at all for a basic Game but if you want something custom, the Framework is provided.</p>
				<p>
					There are two elements to a custom Renderer. One is the Renderer class itself, the other is a RenderBatch.
					<div class="info">You only need a RenderBatch class if you want to have different Attributes in the vao. Otherwise using the existing RenderBatch classes is completely acceptable.</div>
				</p>
				<h3> The RenderBatch Class </h3>
				<p>
					First we have to create a RenderBatch class. Name it whatever you want. Preferably <code>[YourRendererType]RenderBatch</code>.
					It should be a subclass of the RenderBatch class. You will have to have a constructor invoking it super constructor <code>RenderBatch(int maxBatchSize, int zIndex, Primitive primitive, ShaderDatatype... attributes)</code>.
					<div class="info">Currently, Azurite only supports the QUAD Primitive.</div>
					Also, you will need to override a method, Namely <code>void loadVertexProperties(int index, int offset)</code>.
					For additional functionality, you will need a few methods that we will go over in due time.
					Here is the basic template for a RenderBatch class.
				</p>
				<pre class="syntax-java">
public class YourRenderBatch extends RenderBatch {
	/**
	* Create a default type render batch
	*
	* @param maxBatchSize maximum number of sprites in the batch
	* @param zIndex zIndex of the batch. Used for sorting.
	*/
	YourRenderBatch(int maxBatchSize, int zIndex) {
		super(maxBatchSize, zIndex, Primitive.QUAD, [ShaderAttributesHere]);
	}
	
	/**
	* This function figures out how to add vertices with an origin at the top left
	*
	* @param index index of the primitive to be loaded
	* @param offset offset of where the primitive should start being added to the array
	*/
	@Override
	protected void loadVertexProperties(int index, int offset) {
		// Load data to data[] here.
	}
}
				</pre>
				<p>
					To add a certain primitive to the batch, use <code>load(int index)</code>. The load method takes the index, where the sprite will be loaded to the data array.
					<div class="danger">In the code, Offset refers to the offset into the data[]. Index refers to the index of the primitive. ALWAYS MODIFY THE DATA ARRAY AT OFFSET.</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					Along with this, You will probably also need to override the <code>updateBuffer()</code> method. Here you can check for any changes which will affect rendering.
					For example, the DefaultRenderBatch overrides the updateBuffer method to see if the position or color or texture of the sprite has been changed.
					If so, it loads the sprite to the data array again using <code>load(int index)</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					You will probably want to add a method to the class that loads up a primitive to the RenderBatch. Check DefaultRenderBatch::addSprite as an example.
					In the method, first check if the primitive can actually fit in the batch and check if the zIndex matches. Store the primitive in some form of list data structure if you want.
					Then load up the primitive to the data array using <code>load(index)</code>. The index can be set to the data structure's size - 1. This will load up the primitive correctly to the data[].
				</p>
				<p>
					If you want your renderer to use textures, a convenience method is provided called <code>int addTexture(Texture texture)</code>. This method will add the texture to a List of textures that gets bound before rendering.
					It returns an int that can be loaded up into the data array as the slot to which the texture will be bound to.
				</p>
				
				<div class="info">Look at graphics.renderer.DefaultRenderBatch as an example</div>
				
				<h3> The Renderer Class </h3>
				<p>
					After you have made a RenderBatch class (Or chosen to use an existing RenderBatch class), Its time to make a Renderer.
					The Renderer manages the framebuffer to which it renders, the shader with which it renders and the Batches that it draws.
					Start by creating a new class which extends Renderer. The Renderer class has a type parameter that is the RenderBatch that it handles.
					A few methods are marked abstract and have to be overridden.
				</p>
				<p>
					<code>Shader createShader()</code> should return the shader the renderer is going to use.</li>
					<code>Framebuffer createFramebuffer()</code> should return a new Framebuffer. This framebuffer will be rendered to. If you want to render to the window directly, use the <code>Framebuffer.createDefault()</code> to create a framebuffer that is a wrapper around the default window framebuffer.</li>
				</p>
				<p>
					Apart from this, your renderer must implement a <code>void uploadUniforms(Shader shader)</code> method. As you can tell, upload uniforms to the Shader here.
					Another necessary method is <code>void prepare()</code>. You can set the background of your framebuffer here via <code>Graphics.background(color)</code>. Any other preparation can be done here. This method is called per frame befor rendering.
					If you want, you can override the <code>void add(GameObject gameobject)</code> method. For All registered renderers, this method will be called when a new gameobject has been added to the scene.
				</p>
				<p>
					
				</p>
				<p>
					You can try out your new renderer in you Main Scene class. Instantiate the renderer in the awake method of the scene.
					Then, register it to the scene by calling <code>registerRenderer(you renderer instance here)</code>
					Then call the renderer's init method.
					This automatically will cleanup your renderer and notify it when new gameobjects are added to the scene. The custom renderers will render before the Default Renderer.
				</p>
				<p>
					How would I use the rendered textures I hear you say? Well, first we create a GameObject as a field in the scene. Initialize it in the awake method.
					After the init method of the Renderer, do this:
				</p>
				<pre class="syntax-java">
gameObject.addComponent(new SpriteRenderer(new Sprite(Texture.wrap(renderer.fetchColorAttachment([attachment you want to fetch from the fbo])))));
				</pre>
				<p>
					When this object gets rendered, it will reflect the most recently rendered texture.
				</p>
				
				<h3> Conclusion </h3>
				<p>
					And Thats it! You created a Renderer and A Render Batch.
					(Go You! You da best! :D)
					If you have any questions, ping @VoxelRifts#3089 in the Games-With-Gabe discord.

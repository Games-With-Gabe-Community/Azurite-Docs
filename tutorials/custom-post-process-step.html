                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    The Post Processing Framework for Azurite is very flexible. A few Post Processing steps are provided out-of-the-box but creating custom steps is easy with Azurite as well.
                    There are two parts to creating a custom step, A Step java class, and its corresponding shader program in assets.

                    In Azurite's Post Processing Framework, all textures are denoted by an integer. This Integer is the texture's id.
                    There is no dealing in Texture instances.
                </p>
                <h3> The Step Class </h3>
                <p>
                    To create a custom step, you will first need a step class. This class should extend <code>PostProcessStep</code> and implement all methods and a constructor.
                    The MOST basic example of a PostProcessStep is <code>postProcess/ForwardToTexture</code>. All it does is renders a given texture to another framebuffer.
                    So it can be used in debugging if one of the steps is not working as intended to inspect the texture at any given stage.
                    It looks like this:
                </p>
                <pre class="syntax-java">
public class ForwardToTexture extends PostProcessStep {
	/** Id of input texture */
	private int textureID;

	/**
	 * Default Constructor
	 * @param target Where the final texture is to be rendered
	 */
	public ForwardToTexture(Target target) {
		super(target);
	}

	/**
	 * Create the shader to be used for this step
	 * @return the created shader
	 */
	@Override
	public Shader createShader() {
		return Assets.getShader("src/assets/shaders/forward.glsl");
	}

	/**
	 * Prepare the framebuffer by clearing it and binding any textures required
	 */
	@Override
	public void prepare() {
		Graphics.background(Graphics.defaultBackground);
		bindTexture(textureID, 0);
	}

	/**
	 * Upload uniforms to the shader
	 */
	@Override
	protected void uploadUniforms(Shader shader) {
		shader.uploadTexture("uTexture", 0);
	}

	/**
	 * Set the input texture id
	 * @param textureID input texture id
	 */
	public void setTexture(int textureID) {
		this.textureID = textureID;
	}
}
            </pre>
            <p>
                Let's dissect this class to see what all we have to do in order to create our own step. A few methods will have to be implemented,
                namely <code>createShader()</code>, <code>prepare()</code> and <code>uploadUniforms(Shader shader)</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, the <code>createShader()</code> method. Here you are meant to return the Shader that this step will use.
                We will get to creating the shader program itself soon.
                This can be done using <code>Assets.getShader([path to shader relative to project root directory])</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, the <code>prepare()</code> method. Here you are meant to prepare the framebuffer and opengl context before rendering.
                This means clearing the background using <code>Graphics.background([Whatever color here])</code> AND binding the textures to their respective texture units.
                A Utility function is provided in this class to bind a texture to a texture unit which is <code>bindTexture(textureID, textureUnit)</code>.
                What is the textureID I hear you ask. For all basic steps, we will need an input texture. This is done by having a field called textureID and making a setter method for it.
                So to input a texture, users can do <code>WhateverStepInstance.setTexture([texture here])</code> and then apply to run the step.
                <div class="info">Check the class WeightedCombine. if you want to have more than one texture.</div>
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, the <code>uploadUniforms(Shader shader)</code> method. Here you have to, you guessed it, upload uniforms to the provided shader.
            </p>
            <h3> The Shader </h3>
            <p>
                The input attributes for a step shader should be vec2 (Vertex Positions) and vec2 (Texture Coordinates).
                Everything else is up to the user of the framework.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is recommended that you copy the contents of <code>forward.glsl</code> as it is the very barebones shader program for a
                Post Processing Step and make changes/edits.
            </p>
            <h3> Conclusion </h3>
            And Thats it! You created a Post Processing Step that can be used like any other step. If you have any questions, ping @VoxelRifts#3089 in the Games-With-Gabe discord.
